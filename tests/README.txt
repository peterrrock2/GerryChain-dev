This folder contains tests (and subfolders that also contain tests).

As a convention (at least for now - October 2025), tests that Fred
Mueller adds will be named test_frm_...  Eventually the names should
be changed to have the "_frm" deleted, but for now it will help 
identify big changes in testing
