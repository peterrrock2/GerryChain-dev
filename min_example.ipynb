      " |  multigraph (have multiple edges between nodes). Each node and edge\n",
      " |  (although rarely used for edges) is indexed by an integer id. These ids\n",
      " |  are stable for the lifetime of the graph object and on node or edge\n",
      " |  deletions you can have holes in the list of indices for the graph.\n",
      " |  Node indices will be reused on additions after removal. For example:\n",
      " |\n",
      " |  .. jupyter-execute::\n",
      " |\n",
      " |         import rustworkx as rx\n",

      " |\n",
      " |  Additionally, each node and edge contains an arbitrary Python object as a\n",
      " |  weight/data payload. You can use the index for access to the data payload\n",
      " |  as in the following example:\n",
      " |\n",
